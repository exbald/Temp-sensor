# Temp-sensor
Temp sensor for raspberry pi

https://pimylifeup.com/raspberry-pi-temperature-sensor/

Two scripts to save the output in .csv  in /code are working. 

Would be great to have everything saved into MySQL (all sensors eventually), but having troubles with temp sensor to begin with.  
MySQLdb library was installed and MySQL server is running OK. Could be something to do with Python 3 ver?
