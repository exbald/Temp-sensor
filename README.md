# Temp-sensor
Temp sensor for raspberry pi

Two scripts (in /code) to save the output in .csv (in /output) are working. 

Would be great to have everything saved into MySQL (all sensors eventually).
MySQLdb library was installed and MySQL server is running OK. 

Could be something to do with Python 3 ver?
